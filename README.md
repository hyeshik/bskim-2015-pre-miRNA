# Supplementary Data for B. Kim et al. (2015)

This repository includes scripts and interactive notebooks for the data analysis of the high-throughput
sequencing of pre-miRNAs in HeLa cells. See the supplementary experimental procedures included in the
manuscript for the detailed descriptions of the analytic processes.

## Availability of the sequencing data

You can download the FASTQ files enclosing the reads from pre-miRNA sequencing
from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with an
[accession number GEO64482](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE64482).
